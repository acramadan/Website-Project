# Website-Project

This is a personal project to explore UI development.

Website-Project is currently being hosted through AWS Amplify with AWS Route53. URL: www.AshleyRamadan.com

The goal is to create a personal website that houses details about my work experience that employers can review. On top of being a personal website, this project is also to showcase my progress in teaching myself web development.

This website will also host my family archiving project where my family can explore family history.

Languages/tools new to me so far:
 - CSS
 - HTML
 - VS Code (Never used this IDE before)
 - Javascript

What I want to incorporate further:
 - Node.js
 - JS React
 - Creative CSS
