                Hello and welcome to my website! It's a work in progress since I'm continuously learning html, css, backend programming, and so on. (Though it's a big win if you're able to read this!)
            </p>
            <p class="resume-text">
                For now, this will be a page with a general cover letter and below you'll find my resume. <br><br>
                
                I'm currently a senior attending the University of Alabama, majoring in computer science with a minor in mathematics. I've been doing a little bit of everything within these last couple years! My first real job at 17 was at a Toyota car dealership as a car saleswoman and that led to an internship following my freshman year of college at Southeast Toyota. While I was there, I worked in data management where I learned how to manipulate data in on-premises servers, this was where I found my strange passion to pursue data and first dabbled in machine-learning projects. <br><br>
                
                After that I landed an opportunity to work with cloud data at NextEra Energy. I had two titles that I often interchange on my resume: "Cloud Data Engineering Intern" and "Cloud Computing Intern". The latter is less of a mouthful. During my summer, I worked closely with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for the first time and built the backend of my project: a platform to query AWS Cost and Usage reports from the AWS console. You can get a sense of what that looks like below.
