# Website-Project

This is a personal project to explore UI development.

The goal is to create a personal website that houses details about my work experience that employers can review. After the code is written, I plan to host it through
AWS to demonstrate my knowledge of cloud technologies.

This website will also host my family archiving project where my family can explore family history.

Tools new to me so far:
 - CSS
 - HTML
 - VS Code (Never used this IDE before)
 - Javascript
